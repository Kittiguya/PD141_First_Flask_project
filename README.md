WOOHOO ANOTHER REPO CREATED WHICH MEANS ANOTHER READ ME YAY!
I chose a gaming theme for this flask project. You can add/delete/edit the users while also reading which users are in the system (defaulted with 2)
I also added an entire way to add more games that fall under the genres i have specified. I however did not add the games to the respected genre. I chose to stay simple. 
Fairly certain i can add what i want to those pages by following the same PUT/DELETE/POST methods but using the tags associated with the genre. I was just being lazy. 
Anyways i hope you enjoy! These will only improve the more im taught and learn! 

I added an entire genre category. And made sure to tag the genres and the games together. I haven't properly linked them. The values are just assigned by default now. 
There is a create/get/put/delete created for genres now. 
You'll notice genre is set up 2 seperate ways as Genre and genre. That was just to ensure there werent any conflicting spelling errors for w.e the pc could find. (it didnt happen, this was a precautionary step)



Kind of stuck, data base is initiliazed and connected properly. Everything still shows on my personal end using Postman that Games/Genres both still do everything right. Users still return the not allowed error. 
Only thing not tried is converting things to MethodView (100% sure itll fix the users issues ive ran into). 
Other issue is: for some weird reason anything i submit through postman isnt being pushed through to the live database. That might be another issue of needing MethodView for what im trying to accomplish.
