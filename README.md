WOOHOO ANOTHER REPO CREATED WHICH MEANS ANOTHER READ ME YAY!
I chose a gaming theme for this flask project. You can add/delete/edit the users while also reading which users are in the system (defaulted with 2)
I also added an entire way to add more games that fall under the genres i have specified. I however did not add the games to the respected genre. I chose to stay simple. 
Fairly certain i can add what i want to those pages by following the same PUT/DELETE/POST methods but using the tags associated with the genre. I was just being lazy. 
Anyways i hope you enjoy! These will only improve the more im taught and learn!
